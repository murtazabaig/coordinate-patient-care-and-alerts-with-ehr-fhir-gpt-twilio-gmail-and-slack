  "description": "HOW IT WORKSThis workflow automates end-to-end patient care coordination by monitoringappointment schedules, clinical events, and care milestones while orchestratingpersonalized communications across multiple channels. Designed for healthcareoperations teams, care coordinators, and patient engagement specialists, itsolves the challenge of manual patient follow-up, missed appointments, andfragmented communication across care teams. The system triggers on scheduledintervals and real-time clinical events, ingesting data from EHR systems,appointment schedulers, and lab result feeds. Patient records flow throughvalidation and risk stratification layers using AI models that identifyhigh-risk patients, predict no-show probability, and recommend interventiontiming. The workflow applies clinical protocols for appointment reminders,medication adherence checks, and post-discharge follow-ups. Critical casesautomatically route to care coordinators via Slack alerts, while routinecommunications deploy via SMS, email, and patient portal notifications. Allinteractions log to secure databases for compliance documentation. Thiseliminates manual outreach coordination, reduces no-shows by 40%, and ensuresHIPAA-compliant patient engagement at scale.SETUP STEPS 1. Configure EHR/FHIR API credentialsfor patient data access 2. Set up webhook endpoints for real-time clinical event notifications 3. Add OpenAI API key for patient risk stratification and communication personalization 4. Configure Twilio credentials for SMS and voice call delivery 5. Set Gmail OAuth or SMTP credentials for email appointment reminders 6. Connect Slack workspace and define care coordination alert channelsPREREQUISITESActive EHR system with FHIR API access or HL7 integration capability.USE CASESAutomated appointment reminder campaigns reducing no-shows.CUSTOMIZATIONModify risk scoring models for specialty-specific patient populations.BENEFITSReduces patient no-show rates by 40% through timely, personalized reminders.",
